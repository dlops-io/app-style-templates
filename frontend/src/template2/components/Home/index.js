Simply put, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies or digital money. They don't exist physically like the coins and cash people all around the world use today, but instead they're completely virtual. Although we can't see or touch cryptocurrencies, they do hold value. Cryptocurrencies can be stored in a 'digital wallet' on a smartphone or computer, and owners can send them to people to buy things." },

Expectations had grown in recent months that the government may soften its view on digital currencies. The ban would relate to all private cryptocurrencies with certain exceptions to allow the promotion of the underlying technology and its uses. Cryptocurrency prices dropped on Indian exchanges after the decision on the bill's future was announced." },

Gamers have created an online version of the programme, for which you need the Squid cryptocurrency to play. On Tuesday, it was worth a modest 1 cent, but by Friday it had exploded in value, reaching $4.39 (Â£3.18). But Squid has been criticised for not allowing investors to resell their tokens. The dystopian series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation." },
